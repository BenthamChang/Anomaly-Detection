## Data Mining Goal

1. Detected anomolous output based on input materials via supervised learning under limited size of data.
2. Detected anomolous output based on input materials via unsupervised learning.

## Analysis

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Missing Value Treatment
3. Anomaly Detection
    - Linear Model
    - Isolation Forest
    - Hierarchical Clustering
    - Multivariate SPC

## Conclusion

1. Identified the most critical input materials that lead to anomaly via observing linear model's p-value.
2. Detected problematic input materials and ranked them from high to low based on the predicted probability.
